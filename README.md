# Markdowner
A web based markdown viewer. Markdowner processes everything client side. Nothing from the user is collected.

To use Markdowner just put the contents of the Markdowner sub-directory into your web root.

Markdown uses [https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown](Showdown) as its markdown converter.
and [https://jquery.com/](jQuery).
